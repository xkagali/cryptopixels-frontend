## The Problem

With the COVID-19 situation, establishments (eg restaurants, movie theaters, shopping malls, cafes etc) are having a hard time getting customers/visitors and also most locals of Singapore do not explore this little island and don't know that there are many places/attractions to visit.

## The Solution

We knew that we had to make something fun to give users incentive to want to visit these places, yet at the same time, it cannot be something complicated or too simple that migth not be able to capture the attention/time of our users. With the hype of NFTs, we thought it would be something that we could jump on and as it was easy to understand and fun to collect.

## The Plan

We decided to have an NFT that's cute but generic enough that can be loved by many people. We felt pixel characters would work as even though the style may not be modern, the possibilities of the shape, colors and design will help appeal to young adults and the retro aspect might bring a nostalgic feeling for adults.

Now that we have chosen the NFT, we started planning the interface of the site.
